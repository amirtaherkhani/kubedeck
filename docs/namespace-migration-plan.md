# Namespace migration preparation

Prepared from read-only live metadata on 2026-10-10. The approved k6-only stage is now complete; all other mappings remain preparation. The current profile remains operational. See the [namespace architecture](namespace-proposal.md).

## Current state

- No running NATS, RabbitMQ or Kafka Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets or Services were found; the current Helm inventory contains no matching releases. Do not infer running brokers from retained PVCs or monitoring links.
- Infisical's `platform-secrets/redis-master` is 1/1 ready and stays internal. Its PostgreSQL and all other `platform-secrets` resources stay in place.
- Doctor passes 8/8, enrollment reports two projects. The mapped agent, k6, Traefik, cert-manager, registry and Technitium workloads were ready at inspection.
- Preserve all system namespaces, all ten bound `platform-storage` PVCs, and all other bound claims. No namespace rename, broker installation or data move is included.

## Mapping recorded before the k6 stage

Names below stay the same unless a separate reviewed plan says otherwise. Target namespace resources do not yet exist as a result of this work.

| Current objects / ownership | Intended namespace | Dependencies and gate |
|---|---|---|
| `development-tools`: Deployment, Service and ServiceAccount `kuchdesk-agent`; Helm release `kuchdesk-agent` | `platform-tools` | Secret references `kuchdesk-agent-auth`, `kuchdesk-host-bridge-token`; ConfigMap `kuchdesk-host-bridge-ca`; current ClusterRoleBinding `kuchdesk-agent-admin` binds this account to `cluster-admin`. Requires explicit security approval; do not copy/extend that binding automatically. |
| `observability-tests`: Deployment `k6-operator-controller-manager`, Service `k6-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service`, ServiceAccount `k6-operator-controller`; Helm release `k6-operator` | `platform-tests` | Role/RoleBinding `k6-operator-leader-election-role` / `k6-operator-leader-election-rolebinding`; ClusterRoleBindings `k6-operator-manager-rolebinding`, `k6-operator-metrics-auth-rolebinding`; metrics discovery and test manifests. Requires approval of exact new subjects, with no broader rules. |
| `platform-system`: Deployment/Service/ServiceAccount `traefik`; manually managed Service `traefik-lan`; Helm release `traefik` | `platform-networking` | ClusterRoleBinding `traefik-platform-system`, ingress class/provider scope, LAN ports, TLSStore and certificate Secret references. Preserve existing traffic until replacement routing passes checks. |
| `platform-system`: Deployments/Services/ServiceAccounts `cert-manager`, `cert-manager-cainjector`, `cert-manager-webhook`; Helm release `cert-manager` | `platform-networking` | ClusterRoleBinding subjects, webhook Service namespace and CA trust, leader election, cluster-resource namespace and private CA. Move only in an explicitly approved PKI/security plan. |
| `technitium`: StatefulSet `technitium`, Services `technitium` and `technitium-lan`, claim `data-technitium-0`; no Helm ownership annotation observed | `platform-networking` eventually | Bound data, DNS continuity, admin Secret and Host DNS job namespace/service references. No volume move/rebind/delete authorized. Keep current instance until backup/restore and cutover are separately approved. |
| `platform-system`: Deployment `kuchdesk-local-registry`, mounted claim `kuchdesk-local-registry`; no Helm ownership annotation observed | `platform-tools` eventually | Bound registry data and local port-forward/LaunchAgent target. Preserve additional bound claim `kubedeck-local-registry`; its consumer/ownership requires review. No claim operation authorized. |
| Certificates `development-tools/local-dev-tls`, `observability-tests/local-dev-tls` | Respective target namespaces only if still needed | Namespaced certificate Secret delivery and consumers must be reviewed. Existing certificates remain; provisioning/copying credentials is security-gated. |
| `platform-system/Certificate local-dev-ca`; ClusterIssuers `local-dev-ca` and `local-dev-selfsigned` | Keep current placement during initial preparation | CA Secret `local-dev-ca` and cert-manager cluster-resource namespace are coupled. Never relocate/export the private key as routine namespace preparation. |
| `development-tools/ServiceAccount kubedesk-infisical-reader`, its token-request roles/bindings | Keep in `development-tools` initially | Independent auth anchor; moving the agent does not require moving this account. Optional later move to `platform-tools` requires the coordinated security change below. |
| `observability` resources, including Grafana and `InfisicalSecret/grafana-admin` | Unchanged | Grafana remains with observability. Dedicated future broker/database UIs follow their functional service; generic management UIs belong in `platform-tools`. |
| `platform-secrets`, system namespaces, `platform-storage` and ten claims | Unchanged | Explicit preservation boundary. Shared database and messaging services are future designs, not migrations of these claims. |

cert-manager has cluster-scoped bindings for cainjector; controller approve, certificates, certificate-signing requests, challenges, clusterissuers, ingress-shim, issuers and orders; and webhook subject-access reviews. Its MutatingWebhookConfiguration and ValidatingWebhookConfiguration both target `platform-system/cert-manager-webhook`. A release move must review their exact rendered ownership and subjects; do not install competing controllers or adopt cluster-scoped resources blindly.

## Infisical namespace-bound authentication

Fresh readback confirms Kubernetes Auth allows exactly namespace `development-tools` and account `kubedesk-infisical-reader`, with 900-second token TTL/max TTL and no persisted reviewer JWT.

- `observability/InfisicalSecret grafana-admin` points to that account and the unchanged backend Service in `platform-secrets`.
- ClusterRoleBinding `kubedesk-infisical-token-reviewer` targets that account.
- Role/RoleBinding `kubedesk-infisical-token-request` grants the Operator account `platform-secrets/infisical-opera-controller-manager` TokenRequest only for that named reader.
- The Helm-owned `development-tools/infisical-opera-manager-role` and `infisical-opera-manager-rolebinding` also target the Operator and include the narrowed TokenRequest rule. Review both rule sources together; retain the resource-name restriction.

Leaving this anchor in place avoids an immediate auth migration. Any later move must explicitly approve the new account, exact RBAC subjects/rules, Infisical allowed namespace/name, Operator namespace scope and Grafana account reference as one bounded change. Do not temporarily allow all namespaces or unrelated accounts. Preserve the same Infisical Host Admin/K8 read-only model.

## Configurable project mapping

Kubedesk Platform owns shared infrastructure. Each managed project has its own Infisical project and configurable namespace/environment mapping keyed by the stable project ID. See the proposal's concrete project IDs and configurable `vero` namespace example for the `vero-finance` project. Neither the project name nor `vero` is a mandatory namespace name. There is no mandatory `app-` prefix, no substitution of `finance` for `vero-finance`, and no automatic namespace provisioning from Infisical discovery. Provisioning defaults disabled until explicit policy is approved.

Preparation points identified in the repository:

- `lab/site.json`: CA namespace and certificate namespace list; preserve current defaults until cutover.
- `lab/apps/platform/infisical-operator/values.yaml`: Operator namespace scope.
- `lab/apps/observability/k6/tests/smoke-test.yaml` and `lab/README.md`: k6 target namespace and commands.
- `lab/core/exposure/docker-desktop/traefik-lan.yaml` and ingress values: LAN exposure and routing.
- Host installation: `KUCHDESK_HOST_AGENT_NAMESPACE` maps to `-namespace`; update through configuration, not a source-code project-name substitution. Check registry port-forward targets separately.
- Agent Helm release namespace, Service DNS, monitoring targets, certificate references and Secret sources must be rendered and compared together.

Do not switch the checked-in active profile piecemeal before these dependencies are ready. Future alternate profiles should render offline and be reviewed before live use. Supported metadata/policy reload remains available; process settings, identity bindings and Kubernetes Pod settings may require a controlled restart or rollout.

## Execution gates and rollback

1. **Preparation:** render proposed release manifests offline with existing versions, compare object ownership and RBAC, and verify namespace/project mapping. No active profile or live resource changes are made by this document.
2. **Security approval required before live changes:** exact RBAC subject/rule updates, especially the agent's cluster-admin binding; Secret/credential delivery; Kubernetes Auth account/namespace changes; webhook/PKI/CA changes; any network-policy or access expansion. Current authorization allows preparation, not silently granting these privileges.
3. **Data/irreversible approval required:** migration or deletion/rebinding of any bound claim, deletion of source namespaces or persistent workloads, and destructive release cleanup. The ten retained platform-storage claims remain excluded. Backups must be restorable, not merely present.
4. **One service at a time after approval:** preserve existing versions and permissions, use an approved handover rather than concurrent conflicting controllers, and keep the old endpoint until target validation. Namespace changes require replacement/redeployment, not renaming a namespace in place. Helm namespace moves require explicit release/cluster-resource ownership planning; a same-name install in another namespace is not a complete migration.
5. **Health gates:** compare ready replicas and endpoints; Doctor 8/8 with two enrolled projects; authenticated agent API/metrics; k6 controller and metrics target; DNS wildcard and recursive resolution; ingress HTTPS and certificate readiness; Grafana auth sync; positive reader login/read plus denied write and denied unrelated-account login. Verify registry image pull without introducing test credentials or changing data.
6. **Rollback:** record original release revisions, non-secret configuration, routing/Service references and RBAC subjects before cutover. Keep originals until checks pass. On failure, restore the approved original release/subjects/references and traffic endpoint; re-run the same health checks. A Helm rollback alone does not restore moved data or external Infisical auth configuration. Do not delete target or source data as an automatic rollback step.

The approved k6-only stage completed in 11.8 seconds, Helm revision 2 retained in observability-tests. Workloads and metrics are ready in platform-tests; Doctor passed 8/8. CRDs, ClusterRole rules and all ten retained PVCs were preserved. No rollback was needed. See the [stage workflow](../lab/migrations/k6-platform-tests/README.md). All other migrations remain pending their individual gates.

## Repository Helm inventory

Read-only inventory on 2026-10-10 found three tracked `Chart.yaml` files and no tracked `Chart.lock` or Helmfile release definition. None of these three charts declares a `dependencies` list. Upstream dependencies are not thereby proven absent: their remote chart source is outside this local inventory. Release instructions live in the guides; generated overlays are separate from authored charts.

| Repository file / path | Classification and purpose | Current installed release |
|---|---|---|
| `kuchdesk-agent/chart/Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` | Locally authored cluster-agent chart 0.13.0 | `development-tools/kuchdesk-agent`, deployed |
| `lab/apps/observability/grafana/Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `values.homelab.yaml` | Vendored upstream Grafana chart 12.7.3 with local configuration/templates | `observability/grafana`, deployed |
| `lab/tests/infisical-helm-probe/Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` | Locally authored opt-in test chart 0.1.0 | No current installed release found |
| `lab/apps/observability/alloy/values.yaml` | Upstream `grafana/alloy` configuration | `observability/alloy`, chart 1.10.1, deployed |
| `lab/apps/observability/k6/values.yaml` | Upstream `grafana/k6-operator` configuration | `observability-tests/k6-operator`, chart 4.5.0, deployed |
| `lab/apps/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml` | Upstream `prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack` configuration | `observability/monitoring`, chart 87.15.1, deployed |
| `lab/apps/observability/loki/values.yaml` | Upstream `grafana/loki` configuration | `observability/loki`, chart 7.0.0, deployed |
| `lab/apps/observability/tempo/values.yaml` | Upstream `grafana/tempo` configuration | `observability/tempo`, chart 1.24.4, deployed |
| `lab/apps/platform/cert-manager/values.yaml` | Upstream `cert-manager/cert-manager` configuration | `platform-system/cert-manager`, chart v1.21.0, deployed |
| `lab/core/ingress/traefik-docker-desktop-values.yaml` | Upstream `traefik/traefik` configuration | `platform-system/traefik`, chart 39.0.7, deployed |
| `lab/apps/platform/infisical/values.yaml` | Upstream `infisical-helm-charts/infisical` configuration; enables internal Redis, disables MongoDB | `platform-secrets/infisical`, chart 0.4.2, deployed |
| `lab/apps/platform/infisical-operator/values.yaml` and `README.md` | Upstream Secrets Operator configuration plus documented rendering of a supplied chart archive with narrowed TokenRequest RBAC | `platform-secrets/infisical-operator`, chart v0.11.11, deployed |
| `lab/apps/platform/infisical/manifests/postgresql.yaml` | Plain Kubernetes Service/StatefulSet manifest for Infisical PostgreSQL; not a Helm chart or shared database definition | StatefulSet exists in `platform-secrets`; no independent PostgreSQL Helm release found |
| NATS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, shared PostgreSQL/Redis/MongoDB | No corresponding local chart, dependency declaration or values/release definition found | No current shared-service/broker release found |
| metrics-server | No local chart/values file found in this bounded inventory | `kube-system/metrics-server`, chart 3.14.0, deployed |

The upstream release commands and pinned versions are recorded in `lab/README.md`; the Operator's specialized rendering/upgrade instructions are in its own README. No new chart was fetched or installed for this inventory. Retained broker/database PVCs are not chart definitions or proof of current releases.

Operational backup defaults are [native local exports without an added encrypted container](backup-defaults.md), outside Git with restrictive permissions and restoration checks. No backup was created for the k6 move. Infisical upgrade work is paused; see the [storage audit and checkpoint](platform-storage-audit-2026-10-10.md).

## Next approval bundle: stateless KuchDesk agent

Prepared, not applied. Fresh inspection confirms release `kuchdesk-agent` revision **6**, chart **0.13.0**, source Deployment 1/1 ready and target namespace `platform-tools` absent.

Proposed smallest remaining stage:

- Create `platform-tools`; move Deployment, Service and ServiceAccount `kuchdesk-agent` from `development-tools`, retaining the same image, configuration and names. Keep the Helm release record in `development-tools` using a reviewed namespace post-renderer, as with k6.
- Copy existing Secrets `kuchdesk-agent-auth` and `kuchdesk-host-bridge-token` to the target namespace through an in-memory private workflow; reuse their existing data without printing, rotating or placing it in Git. Retain the source copies for rollback. Copy ConfigMap `kuchdesk-host-bridge-ca`, which contains the public trust certificate. No private key, certificate issuance, CA/Issuer or Infisical identity change is included.
- Change only the namespace of the `kuchdesk-agent` ServiceAccount subject in ClusterRoleBinding `kuchdesk-agent-admin` and RoleBinding `kube-system/kuchdesk-agent-coredns`. Preserve `cluster-admin` and the existing CoreDNS Role/rules exactly; do not add privileges. This is an explicit security approval gate, including the one binding in kube-system; no CoreDNS ConfigMap or other system resource changes are proposed.
- Keep `development-tools`, the Infisical reader ServiceAccount, its RBAC/auth restrictions, Grafana's reference, all PVCs and other workloads unchanged. Update only relevant client namespace/port-forward references. The internal Service DNS moves to `kuchdesk-agent.platform-tools.svc`; do not silently assume external clients already use it.

Expect a brief interruption to the agent API/SSE stream, followed by reconnect. Its in-memory operation history is not durable; confirm no active operations before stopping it and defer if the idle state cannot be established. No unrelated application service should be restarted.

Health gates: target 1/1 Ready, `/healthz` and `/readyz`, authenticated cluster snapshot and SSE reconnect, Host bridge/Infisical metadata reads, Doctor 8/8, unchanged CoreDNS configuration, and unchanged Infisical/K8 permissions. Allow five minutes for readiness. On failure, roll Helm back to revision **6** in `development-tools`, restore the original two RBAC subjects and client references, and verify source readiness/health. Preserve the old namespace and Secret copies; no automatic data cleanup.

Offline manifest comparison prepared from the exact current release changes only the three resource namespace fields and two RBAC subjects; the CoreDNS Role remains identical. Secret values were not read for preparation. The target Secret/ConfigMap copies and live security changes require the specific approval above. No gated action has been executed.

## Verification-helper preservation

The active worktree's two untracked activation-helper source files were copied byte-for-byte to a private task archive under the Codex task-artifacts directory. Copies use `.go.txt`, with SHA-256 manifest, directory mode0700 and files0600. Independent source review found no embedded actual credential literal. No environment/session files, credentials, binaries or database data were included.

This is historical acceptance-test source, not a supported production command. It has hard-coded installation IDs/paths, mutable authentication/probe modes, best-effort cleanup and direct session reads with fewer safeguards than production storage code. Preserve it for evidence; do not execute it without fresh review. Original files and worktree remain intact; no cleanup was performed.
